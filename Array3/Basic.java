		1. Array is a continuous block of memory which is used to store homogeneous type of values
		2. Array is fixed in size, and it is a non static member.
		3. To access the elements of array we have to use index, Which starts from 0 till n-1 where n is the total number of elements.
		4. If we cross the range of the index, then we will get the array index out of bounds exception.
		5. It can also be used to store default values.
		          In java there are two ways to create array
						
						1.By using array literal:
						datatype[] variable_name= {val1,val2,val3.....valn};
						
						--> when we aware the values or We know what we are storing in array.
						
						
						2. By using new keyword:
						datatype[] variable_name= new datatype[size];
						
						--> We are taking input from user or When we dont know the what we are storing in array but we dont know the size, we have to mention size
